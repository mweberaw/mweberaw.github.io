If you have at least some experience with system administration, running an own server gives you some advantages. You can gain some experience with linux, get some insight into how linux servers work and you can choose which services you use and you still know, where your data resides.
This all sounds promising, at least to me, and it also solves many problems where the services offered by some providers are not configured the way I like them to be.</description></item></channel></rss>
