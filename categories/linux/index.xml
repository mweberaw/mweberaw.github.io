One is to use mod_php. This module integrates PHP directly into the server itself. PHP is started when the server starts and runs under the same user as the Apache server itself.
An alternative configuration is to start a new PHP process for each request that serves a PHP script. This is know as CGI and is quite well supported by PHP and Apache alike.</description></item><item><title>Backing up a linux vserver using a Synology Diskstation</title><link>https://mweberaw.github.io/post/2013-09-08-backing-up-a-linux-vserver-using-a-synology-diskstation/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mweberaw.github.io/post/2013-09-08-backing-up-a-linux-vserver-using-a-synology-diskstation/</guid><description>If you have your own linux vserver or root server, you most probably also have information on this server that you do not want to lose. Backing up the data of the server is the most crucial part in avoiding information loss by anything that can happen to your server. For those who have a Synology Diskstation, this task is not too complex.
First make sure rsync is installed on the server you have to backup.</description></item></channel></rss>
